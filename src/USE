DESCRIPTION
       monpetitami is a simple SGE or TORQUE/Maui monitoring tool. Is is designed to show Jobs by group/queue/efficiency and MAUI FS based on QoS.  On SGE, FS and
       efficiency is not implemented.

       This script runs as a demon under monpetitami user, and its user must be able to see all qstat queue and run daignose -g command.

       It read its config from /etc/monpetitami.conf .

       Schedule::SGE is needed, but not added to package dependecy cause it’s not under any known repo. Please install it by hand.  You need Special Schedule::SGE with
       Schedule::SGE::HStatus. Contact arnau.bria at gmail dot com if you don’t find it.

       Notice that Proc::PID::File must be  perl-Proc-PID-File-1.X, not 0.X.

       The script uses ganglia’s gmetric to send data to ganglia server, so correct ganglia conf is expected.

       You need monpetitami-monitor under ganglia’s server /var/www/cgi-bin directory.

       See monpetitami-monitor’s man page for further help.
